    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-Polymorphism: Polymorphism means \"many forms\" and refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond differently to the same message or method invocation. In polymorphism, a single method name can be used to perform different operations based on the type of object it is called upon. It allows objects of different types to be treated uniformly, providing flexibility, modularity, and code extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (properties) and methods (behaviors) together within a class. It involves hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only the necessary information through well-defined interfaces. Encapsulation provides data abstraction, data integrity, and modularity, allowing objects to interact with each other while maintaining data privacy and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Inheritance: Inheritance allows the creation of new classes (derived classes or subclasses) based on existing classes (base classes or superclasses). The derived classes inherit the properties and behaviors of the base class, which they can use as-is or modify as per their specific requirements. Inheritance promotes code reuse, extensibility, and the hierarchical organization of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by representing only the essential features while hiding unnecessary details. It involves creating abstract classes or interfaces that define the common properties and behaviors of a group of objects. Abstraction allows for modeling real-world entities or concepts at a higher level, focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. It provides a clear separation between the interface and implementation, promoting code reusability, maintainability, and system scalability."
