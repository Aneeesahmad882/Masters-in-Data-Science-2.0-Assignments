    "A database is an organized collection of structured data that is stored and managed in a computer system. It provides a way to store, retrieve, update, and manage data efficiently. Databases are commonly used in various applications and systems to handle large volumes of data and enable effective data management.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not only SQL) are two different types of database management systems that handle data in distinct ways. Here's a differentiation between the two:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-Data Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL: SQL databases are based on the relational data model, which organizes data into tables with predefined schemas. Each table consists of rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established through primary and foreign keys.\n",
    "NoSQL: NoSQL databases use various data models, such as key-value, document, columnar, or graph, to store and organize data. They are designed to be flexible and schema-less, allowing for dynamic and unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Scalability:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL: SQL databases typically scale vertically, meaning they handle increased data loads by upgrading hardware resources, such as adding more powerful servers or increasing memory and storage capacity.\n",
    "NoSQL: NoSQL databases are designed for horizontal scalability, which means they can distribute data across multiple servers or nodes, allowing for easy expansion as data volume or traffic grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Schema:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL: SQL databases enforce a rigid schema where the structure and data types of the stored data must adhere to a predefined schema. Any changes to the schema require altering the table structure.\n",
    "NoSQL: NoSQL databases are schema-less or have a flexible schema. They allow for dynamic and evolving data structures, making it easier to handle unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-Query Language:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL: SQL databases use SQL as the standard query language for performing operations like data retrieval, modification, deletion, and aggregation. SQL provides a declarative approach to query data based on specific criteria.\n",
    "NoSQL: NoSQL databases use different query mechanisms depending on the data model. Some provide a query language similar to SQL, while others offer API-based querying or use specialized languages tailored to their data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5-Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL: SQL databases are often used for applications that require complex transactions, strict data consistency, and structured data with well-defined relationships. They are commonly used in financial systems, e-commerce platforms, and traditional business applications.\n",
    "NoSQL: NoSQL databases are suitable for applications dealing with large volumes of unstructured or rapidly changing data, such as social media feeds, real-time analytics, content management systems, and IoT (Internet of Things) data."

    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that deals with defining and managing the structure of a database and its objects. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the commonly used DDL statements with examples:\n",

    "  name VARCHAR(50),\n",

    "2-DROP:\n",
    "The DROP statement is used to remove database objects, such as tables, indexes, views, or constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example : Dropping a Table\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "3-ALTER:\n",
    "The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or dropping columns, modifying constraints, or renaming objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example : Adding a Column to a Table\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "ADD COLUMN email VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "\n",
    "4-TRUNCATE:\n",
    "The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all rows from a table, effectively deleting all data while keeping the table structure intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example : Truncating a Table\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;"

    "DQL stands for Data Query Language. It is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that focuses on querying and retrieving data from a database. DQL is primarily associated with the SELECT statement, which is used to fetch data from one or more tables based on specified criteria.\n",

    "\n",
    "SELECT: This keyword specifies that we want to retrieve specific columns from the table.\n",

    "(a)Primary Key:\n",
    "A primary key is a column or a combination of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a database table. It enforces the entity integrity constraint, ensuring that every row in a table has a unique identifier. The primary key is used to uniquely identify and access specific rows in a table and is crucial for maintaining data integrity and establishing relationships with other tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about primary keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniqueness: Every value in a primary key column must be unique. No two rows in the table can have the same primary key value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-nullability: A primary key column cannot have null values. It ensures that each row has a valid identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Single value or composite key: A primary key can be a single column or a combination of multiple columns (composite key) if a single column is insufficient to guarantee uniqueness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: Primary keys are typically indexed to facilitate faster data retrieval and enforce uniqueness efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b)Foreign Key:\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or a combination of columns in a database table that establishes a link or relationship between two tables. It represents a reference to the primary key of another table and defines a constraint known as a referential integrity constraint. The foreign key constraint ensures that values in the foreign key column(s) of one table correspond to the primary key values in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key points about foreign keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "Relationship: The foreign key establishes a relationship between two tables, typically representing a parent-child relationship or a relationship based on some shared information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Referential integrity: The foreign key constraint ensures that the values in the foreign key column(s) match the values in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table. It helps maintain data consistency and integrity across related tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cascading actions: Foreign keys can define actions to be taken when related rows are updated or deleted, such as cascading updates or deletions to maintain consistency automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple foreign keys: A table can have multiple foreign keys, each referring to a different table or even the same table.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two tables, \"Employees\" and \"Departments,\" with a one-to-many relationship. The \"Departments\" table has a primary key column called \"department_id,\" while the \"Employees\" table has a foreign key column called \"department_id\" that references the \"Departments\" table's primary key."
