    "In Python, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions.\n",
    "When an exceptional condition arises, Python creates an exception object, which contains information about the error.\n",
    "This exception object is then \"raised\" and can be caught and handled by appropriate exception handling mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a syntax error is a type of error that occurs when the Python interpreter encounters invalid code syntax.\n",
    "It happens when the code violates the language's rules and cannot be parsed correctly.\n",
    "Syntax errors prevent the interpreter from running the program, and they need to be fixed before the code can be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the key differences between exceptions and syntax errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-Cause:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions: Exceptions occur at runtime when an unexpected condition or error arises during program execution.\n",
    "Syntax Errors: Syntax errors occur during the parsing of code before the execution, due to violations of the language's syntax rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Occurrence:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions: Exceptions occur when the code is running and encountering a problematic situation.\n",
    "Syntax Errors: Syntax errors occur before the code starts running, as the interpreter is parsing the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions: Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks, allowing the program to gracefully recover from errors.\n",
    "Syntax Errors: Syntax errors must be fixed by correcting the code before it can be executed. They cannot be caught or handled at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-Program Execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions: Exceptions disrupt the normal flow of the program and may cause the program to terminate if not handled properly.\n",
    "Syntax Errors: Syntax errors prevent the program from executing at all, as they are identified during the parsing phase."
