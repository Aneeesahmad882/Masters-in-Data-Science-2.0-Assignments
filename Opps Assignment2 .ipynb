Abstract base classes define a common interface and can specify certain methods as abstract, which means they must be implemented by any concrete subclass.\n",

    "In Python, we can achieve data abstraction through the use of classes, access modifiers, and properties. Data abstraction refers to the concept of hiding the internal representation and implementation details of an object and exposing only the essential information and functionalities to the outside world. Here's how we can achieve data abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-Classes: Classes provide a way to encapsulate related data and functions into a single unit. By defining a class, you can group data and methods together, representing a real-world entity or concept. The internal details of the class, such as its data attributes and implementation logic, are hidden from the outside world, promoting abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Access Modifiers: Python uses naming conventions to indicate the accessibility of class members. By convention, attributes and methods prefixed with a single underscore (_) are considered \"protected,\" indicating that they are intended for internal use within the class or its subclasses. Attributes and methods prefixed with a double underscore (__) are considered \"private,\" indicating that they are intended for internal use within the class only. Although Python doesn't strictly enforce access restrictions, these naming conventions signal to developers the intended visibility and encourage encapsulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Properties: Properties allow us to define getter and setter methods to control the access to class attributes. By using properties, we can expose specific attributes to the outside world while enforcing data validation and encapsulation. Properties provide a way to access and modify attribute values indirectly, ensuring that the necessary checks and operations are performed during access or modification.\n",
